Prototype optimization routine using spotpy package

* Requirements
* How to run
* Todos
** TODO make sure that the reference time of the forcings is equal among all basins (i.e. th 31.12.LASTYEAR 18:00 h)
** TODO Complete the simulation, objectivefunction and evaluation routines for a multi-basin setup
** TODO enable restart option
** TODO enable csv report from spotpy
** TODO add parameter constraints option
** TODO Move the paths from control file to a central location
** TODO check the duration for valid grdc measures.
** TODO Regenerate the default_sim folder at the beginning of the optimization
   - Has to be called from driver.py
   - Maybe make a function out of prepare_domain so we can call it either via cmdline or inside python
